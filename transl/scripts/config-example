# Config file. The meaning of the fields is as follows:

# Path to the Wine source tree to analyze
SOURCEROOT=/path/to/wine-src

# Path to the Wine build tree (if different from SOURCEROOT)
BUILDROOT=/path/to/wine-src

# Path to the Wine tree to take wrc from. Usually the same as SOURCEROOT. 
WRCROOT=/path/to/wine-src

# Directory containing the various scripts
SCRIPTSDIR=.

# The directory where to store the generated langs/ and dumps/. Usually the
# directory with the PHP scripts.
DESTDIR=../php

# Temporary directory for some scratch files. Must be writable.
WORKDIR=../work

# If set to '1' the script will do a minimal build of the SOURCEROOT and WRCROOT
# making the script work even for a just downloaded tree with only ./configure
# executed in it. If you are running the script on trees that are already fully
# built you may set this to '0' to save time.
PREPARE_TREES=1
