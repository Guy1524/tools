To run the scripts, copy scripts/config-example to scripts/config and edit it
to setup the paths. Then, in scripts/, run ./Master.sh to generate the
statistics. If, in scripts/config, you have set to store results in the
directory with PHP scripts from php/, they should be able to display the
statistics. If you want to keep the generated data in a different directory
than the PHP scripts, edit php/config.php so that they can to find it.

You can create files scripts/local-prehook.sh and scripts/local-posthook.sh if
you want to automate e.g. fetching the Git tree before generating the statistics
or push the results to a server after it. Running the scripts with the
environment variable NOVERBOSE set should make them silent enough to make them
usable as a cron job.
