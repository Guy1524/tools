To run the scripts, copy config-example to config and edit it to setup
the paths. Then, run ./Master.sh to generate the statistics. If, in
config, you have set to store results in the directory with the PHP
scripts, they should be able to display the statistics. If you want to
keep the generated data in a different directory than the PHP scripts,
edit config.php so that they can to find it.

You can create files local-prehook.sh and local-posthook.sh if you
want to automate e.g. fetching the Git tree before generating the
statistics or push the results to a server after it. Running the
scripts with the environment variable NOVERBOSE set should make them
silent enough to make them usable as a cron job.
