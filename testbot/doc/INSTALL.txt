1. WineTestBot server setup
---------------------------

Dependencies:
- Apache2 with mod_perl
- MySQL
- Perl DBD and DBI::mysql modules
- Sendmail
- VMware Vix API (http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vix-api)

MySQL setup:
- Create a new 'winetestbot' database and its tables using the
  ddl/winetestbot.sql script.
- Set the 'winetestbot' user password
  INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE on all tables in the database. So this is
  something like:
  SET PASSWORD FOR 'winetestbot'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('mypassword');

Apache setup:
- Create a new virtual host, use doc/vhost_winetestbot.conf as a
  template.
- If you want to enable SSL, make sure you have your certificate set
  up. If you don't want SSL, edit lib/WineTestBot/Config.pm and set
  UseSSL to "!1".
- On OpenSUSE, I had to add "perl" to APACHE_MODULES in
  /etc/sysconfig/apache2.
- On Debian you may have to install libapache2-mod-perl2 and create a
  perl.load symbolic link in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.

General setup for the web site:
- Create a new system group 'winehq' and a system user 'winehq',
  make sure to make user winehq a member of group winehq.
- Clone Wine's tools repository to $HOME/tools (so this document
  should be available as $HOME/tools/testbot/doc/INSTALL.txt).
- Create directory $HOME/tools/testbot/var, create subdirs
  'jobs', 'latest', 'socket' and 'staging' and a file called log within this
  directory. Set owner/group to wwwrun/winehq for staging (where 'wwwrun' is
  the account your apache server runs under). Run:
    cd $HOME/tools/testbot
    mkdir var
    cd var
    touch log
    mkdir jobs latest patches socket staging
    sudo chown WWWRUN:winehq staging
    chmod g+w *
- If the installation path is different from the default, then some paths
  in the following files will need to be modified:
    testbot/lib/startup.pl
    testbot/scripts/CheckWineTestBot.pl
- Install scripts/initd in /etc/init.d/winetestbot and adjust the paths and
  user name if necessary. Then activate it.
  (typically "chkconfig winetestbot on" or "service winetestbot start")
- Copy lib/WineTestBot/ConfigLocalTemplate.pl to
  lib/WineTestBot/ConfigLocal.pl and fill in the options for your site.
- Restart Apache, you should now be able to browse to the home page.
- Register a new account for yourself.
- Using the mysql client, set the ResetCode in your Users entry to a
  known value, e.g.
  mysql> update Users set ResetCode = 'a' where Name = '<username>';
- Browse to http://server.name/ResetPassword.pl and enter your username,
  the resetcode you just updated and a new password.
- Make yourself admin by adding a row to UserRoles:
  mysql> insert into UserRoles values('<username>', 'admin');
- When you refresh the home page, you should now have an "Admin" menu
  in the sidebar.

Janitorial tasks:
- Run the Janitor.pl script once per day to perform the janitorial
  tasks. For instance:
  17 30 * * * /home/winehq/tools/testbot/bin/Janitor.pl
- Run the CheckWineTestBot.pl script periodically to get notified in
  case the WineTestBot server dies. For instance:
  * 5 * * * /home/winehq/tools/testbot/scripts/CheckWineTestBot.pl

Setup for Wine's patches site:
- See http://source.winehq.org/patches/ for reference.
- Before trying to set this up make sure that you can submit patches
  using the WineTestBot web interface and that the results are sane.
  You may also want to run with $PatchFromEMailOverride set for a while
  to spot any issue under load.
- First bootstrap things with WinePatchesWebGet.pl. Go to the patches
  website and write down the id of the oldest and newest patches you
  want to inject into WineTestBot. Then run:
  ./bin/WinePatchesWebGet.pl OLD_PATCH_ID NEW_PATCH_ID

- If that goes well you can then keep WineTestBot up to date by
  following the steps below.
- Set up an email address to receive the patches site notifications
  and send that email address to the patches maintainer.
- Arrange for the WinePatchesWebNotify.pl script to be fed the
  notification emails. One way to do so would be to use procmail and
  add the following lines to the $HOME/.procmailrc file:
    :0c:
    * ^Subject: New patches available at
    | $HOME/tools/testbot/bin/WinePatchesWebNotify.pl

Setup for Winetest updates:
- Use a cron job to run CheckForWinetestUpdate.pl periodically. For
  instance:
  * 0 * * * /home/winehq/tools/testbot/bin/CheckForWinetestUpdate.pl 32
  * 0 * * * /home/winehq/tools/testbot/bin/CheckForWinetestUpdate.pl 64

Setup for wine-patches:
- A proper WineTestBot system should integrate with Wine's patches site.
  An alternative is to interface directly with wine-patches as described in
  this section.
- Arrange for the WinePatchesMLSubmit.pl script to be fed the
  wine-patches emails. One way to do so would be to subscribe the
  winehq user to the wine-patches mailing list and to then add the
  following lines to the .procmailrc file:
    :0c:
    * ^List-Id: Wine Patch Submissions
    * ^TO wine-patches
    | $HOME/tools/testbot/bin/WinePatchesMLSubmit.pl
- Or if you have a set of patches to test in the mbox format you can
  test with:
  formail -ds $HOME/tools/testbot/bin/WinePatchesMLSubmit.pl <mbox-file


2. VM hosts setup
-----------------

Dependencies:
- VMware


3. Wine build VM setup
----------------------

- Create a Linux VM and set it up so it can generate PE executables
  with MinGW. For instance on Debian you should install autoconf,
  bison, flex, gcc, gcc-mingw-w64, git and make. If you are going to
  have 64bit VMs then make sure MinGW can generate 64bit PE executables.
- Install netcat.
- Create a new system group 'winehq' and a system user 'winehq',
  make sure to make user winehq a member of group winehq.
- Clone Wine's tools repository to $HOME/tools (so this document
  should be available as $HOME/tools/testbot/doc/INSTALL.txt).
- Create the $HOME/tools/testbot/var directory and make it writable to
  group winehq.
    mkdir $HOME/tools/testbot/var
    chmod g+w $HOME/tools/testbot/var
- Clone the Wine git repository to $HOME/tools/testbot/var/wine-git.
- In the winehq account, run Reconfig.pl.
  Check $HOME/tools/testbot/log/Reconfig.log to make sure it
  succeeded.
- Take a snapshot of the running VM. Make sure restoring this snapshot
  will result in a running build VM.
- Register this VM as a build VM on the web site.


4. Windows test VM setup
------------------------

- FIXME: To document
- Take a snapshot of the running VM. Make sure restoring this snapshot
  will result in a running Windows VM.
- Register this VM on the web site. On a production WineTestBot server
  you would likely want to make it an 'extra' VM until you have
  confirmed that it works as expected.
