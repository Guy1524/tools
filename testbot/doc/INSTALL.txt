Dependencies:

Apache2 with mod_perl
MySQL
Perl DBD and DBI::mysql modules
Sendmail
VMware Vix API (http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vix-api)

MySQL setup:
- Create a new database 'winetestbot' and create tables in that db using the
  ddl/winetestbot.sql script
- Create a new user (e.g. 'winetestbot') and grant that user SELECT, INSERT,
  UPDATE and DELETE on all tables in the database. The user does not need any
  data definition grants

Apache setup:
- Create a new virtual host, use vhost_winetestbot.conf in this dir as template.
- If you want to enable SSL, make sure you have your certificate set up. If
  you don't want SSL, edit lib/WineTestBot/Config.pm and set UseSSL to "!1".
- On OpenSUSE, I had to add "perl" to APACHE_MODULES in /etc/sysconfig/apache2.

General setup:
- Create a new system group 'winetest' and a system user 'winetest', make sure
  to make user winetest a member of group winetest
- Unpack winetestbot source to /usr/lib/winetestbot (so this document should
  be available as /usr/lib/winetestbot/doc/INSTALL.txt)
- Create directory /var/lib/winetestbot, create subdirs 'jobs', 'latest',
  'socket' and 'staging' within this dir. Set owner/group to winetest/winetest
  for jobs, latest, socket, but set owner/group to wwwrun/winetest for staging
  (where 'wwwrun' is the account your apache server runs under). Run
  chmod g+w /var/lib/winetestbot/*
- Create an empty logfile /var/log/winetestbot/log and make it writeable to
  group winetest.
- Install scripts/initd in /etc/init.d/winetestbot and activate it (on OpenSUSE:
  "chkconfig winetestbot on", "service winetestbot start")
- Set up a crontab entry for root to periodically run
  scripts/CheckWineTestBot.pl
- Copy lib/WineTestBot/ConfigLocalTemplate.pl and to
  lib/WineTestBot/ConfigLocal.pl and edit it.
- Restart Apache, you should now be able to browse to the home page
- Register a new account for yourself
- Using the mysql client, set the ResetCode in your Users entry to a known
  value, e.g.
  mysql> update Users set ResetCode = 'a' where Name = '<username>';
- Browse to http://server.name/ResetPassword.pl and enter your username,
  the resetcode you just updated and a new password.
- Make yourself admin by adding a row to UserRoles:
  mysql> insert into UserRoles values('<username>', 'admin');
- When you refresh the home page, you should now have an "Admin" menu in the
  sidebar

Wine build VM setup:
- Create a new system group 'winetest' and a system user 'winetest', make sure
  to make user winetest a member of group winetest
- Unpack winetestbot source to /usr/lib/winetestbot (so this document should
  be available as /usr/lib/winetestbot/doc/INSTALL.txt)
- Create directory /var/lib/winetestbot
- Create an empty logfile /var/log/winetestbot/log and make it writeable to
  group winetest.
- Clone Wine git repo to /var/lib/winetestbot/wine.git
