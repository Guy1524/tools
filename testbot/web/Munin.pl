Analyses the activity of the recent past, computes the corresponding metrics
to be tracked by Munin, and prints the Munin configuration and data on stdout.

Note that defining how far back to go to compute the Munin metrics is tricky.

Munin collects data every 5 minutes so if can be tempting to report on what
happened in the past 5 minutes. However we have to report on infrequent events:
- New jobs arrive infrequently: around one per hour currently, and it is
  not rare for two of them to arrive at the same time. If we were to naively
  extrapolate 1 new job in the past 5 minutes as a rate of 12 jobs per hour
  we'd get a graph with exagerated swings. But note that things would converge
  on a meaningful value as Munin averages things out for the monthly or yearly
  graphs.
- We could instead record when the last job arrived and derive a rate by
  dividing the number of new jobs by that interval. For instance assume the
  rate is 4 jobs/hour, at precisely 15 minutes intervals. So over the course
  of an hour we will report a rate of 4 jobs/hour 4 times, each time the
  result of 1 / 15 * 60, and a rate of 0 the 9 other times. But when Munin then
  goes on to average these, for instance for the monthly graph, it will get
  an hourly rate of 1.3 job/hour = (4*4 + 9*0) / 12, which is wrong.
- Another approach to the above problem would be to not graph a rate but
  simply the number of new jobs in the given period. However the rate is much
  more meaningful. 4 jobs/hour means the TestBot must complete jobs in under
  15 minutes to keep up. But figuring out the rate from a graph of the raw new
  job count would be quite a bit harder for the administrator.
- For the VM operation times (like revert times), chances are that over a
  5 minutes period there is nothing to report, so the value is 'undefined',
  'U'. This results in dashed lines: one short dash for a 5 minutes period and
  then nothing for the next hour. The shorter the period, the shorter and more
  widely spaced the dashes, making the graph hard to read.
- When no data is available in the chosen period, we could also report the
  last value for that operation. For instance if a revert took 15 seconds,
  report 15 seconds until a new revert occurs, thus avoiding the dashed line
  issue. However how long should the last value be reported? Also seeing a
  continuous line for the offline time one could think it means the VM is
  frequently being marked offline.

Taking all this into account, GetOutput() analyzes the past hour.
- This gives meaningful hourly rates.
- And where there are intermittent values the dashes are long enough.
