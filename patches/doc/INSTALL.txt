1. Dependencies
---------------

- Text::CSV::Encoded (libtext-csv-encoded-perl)
- Email::MIME (libemail-mime-perl)


2. General setup
----------------

- Create a new user 'winehq'.
- Clone Wine's tools repository to $HOME/tools (so this document
  should be available as $HOME/tools/patches/README).
- Create directory $HOME/opt/source/git. Run:
    mkdir -p $HOME/opt/source/git
- Clone the Wine repository to a new bare repository (it can be read-only).
    cd $HOME/opt/source/git
    git clone --bare git://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git
- Arrange for the Wine source to be updated regularly. For instance:
    0 * * * * cd $HOME/opt/source/git/wine.git && git fetch

Apache setup:
- Create the $HOME/opt/source directory. This is the root of the source website:
    mkdir -p $HOME/opt/source
- Create a new virtual host, use vhost_source.conf as a template.


3. Setup for the LXR source site
--------------------------------

- FIXME: Document how to set up LXR in $HOME/opt/source.


4. Setup for the patches site
-----------------------------

- Create the $HOME/opt/source/patches directory and copy patches.css there:
    mkdir $HOME/opt/source/patches
    cp patches.css $HOME/opt/source/patches
- Create the $HOME/patches directory where the patch data will live:
    mkdir -p $HOME/patches
- Arrange for the filter script to be fed the wine-devel emails. One way to
  do so would be to subscribe the winehq user to the wine-devel mailing list
  and to then add the following lines to the .procmailrc file:
    :0
    * ^List-Id:.*wine-devel\.winehq\.org
    {
      :0 hbfw
      | $HOME/tools/patches/filter
      :0:
      $HOME/patches/.
    }
- If you have a set of patch emails in the mbox format you can test with:
  formail -ds procmail <mbox-file
- Run update regularly to update the website:
    */5 * * * * $HOME/tools/patches/update

For integration with the WineTestBot, see the corresponding section in the
WineTestBot documentation.


5. Setup for the regressions site
---------------------------------

- Run update-regressions regularly. For instance:
    0 * * * * $HOME/tools/patches/update-regressions
