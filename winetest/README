          Wine Conformance Tests -- report processing suite
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear webmaster,

This machinery is for receiving and analysing the reports resulting
from running programs/winetest.  The winetest program is a single-
executable version of all the DLL conformance test programs suitable
for unattended testing and report submitting.  This package provides
the destination for that and presents the results in an ordered form.

* winetest.conf

Configuration file, sets the following variables:
$queuedir - queue incoming submissions here
$datadir  - processed data get served from here
$builds   - list of allowed build tags

* winetest.cgi

A CGI script, which receives uploads from winetest and provides manual
uploading facility.  Asks the CGI.pm module to create its temporary
file in $queuedir, then renames it to repXXXXX/report.

* winetest.cron

Sample crontab entry illustrating the intended use of the tools.

* dissect

This program looks for a file matching $queuedir/rep*/report, takes it
apart in its directory while also creating summary.txt.  If an error
occurs the directory is renamed to errXXXXX to avoid future attempts
at processing this report.  If everything goes flawlessly the whole
directory is renamed (based on the information learned in the process)
to $datadir/BUILD/VERSION_TAG_DIGIT where DIGIT is for resolving name
clashes and $datadir/BUILD/outdated is created to signal the change in
the given build.  Allowed builds are those in $builds.  See also the
head of the file.

* gather

This program is intended to run as a second stage.  See the sample
crontab file, races and concurrency problems must be dealed with on
that higher level.  The program looks for a file matching
$datadir/*/outdated, creates index.html in the same directory and
removes the outdated file.  See also the head of the file.

* summary.css, summary.js, resultform.html

These files are referenced by the index.html files created by gather.

* winetest.builds

The file to have $builds point to.
