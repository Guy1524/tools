          Wine Conformance Tests -- report processing suite
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear webmaster,

This machinery is for receiving and analysing the reports resulting
from running programs/winetest.  The winetest program is a single-
executable version of all the DLL conformance test programs suitable
for unattended testing and report submitting.  This package provides
the destination for that and presents the results in an ordered form.

* winetest.conf

Configuration file, sets the following variables:
$queuedir - queue incoming submissions here
$datadir  - processed data is served from here

* winetest.cgi

A CGI script, which receives uploads from winetest and provides manual
uploading facility.  Asks the CGI.pm module to create its temporary
file in $queuedir, then renames it to repXXXXX/report.

* winetest.cron

Sample crontab entry illustrating the intended use of the tools.

* summary.css, summary.js, resultform.html

These files are referenced by the index.html files created by gather.
